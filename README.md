A business in Canada, specializing in manufacturing special socks for people with diabetes, faces a decision regarding business development. They must choose either to expand their product line within Canada or to enter the European market. In this project, using a dataset extracted from Amazon over a month, I researched the niche of diabetic products with the goal of identifying in-demand and relatively non-competitive directions for expanding the assortment. Additionally, I assessed the overall market capacity.

Conclusion 1: The market capacity is sufficient to test no more than 2-3 new directions.
Conclusion 2: It is feasible to consider launching footwear, skin care products, and special sportswear for diabetics. There is a demand for these products, but based on reviews, the current offerings do not satisfy consumers. Therefore, there is an opportunity to introduce a product with better quality and better service than the competitors.
